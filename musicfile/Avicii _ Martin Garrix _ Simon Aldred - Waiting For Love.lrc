[00:17.55]Where there's a will there's a way kind of beautiful
[00:21.30]And every night has its day so magical
[00:25.09]And if there's love in this life there's no obstacle
[00:29.01]That can't be defeated
[00:32.60]For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
[00:36.30]In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
[00:40.02]For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
[00:43.89]With something to believe in
[00:48.08]Monday left me broken
[00:51.10]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[00:54.82]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[00:58.62]Thursday waiting for love waiting for love
[01:03.20]Thank the stars it's Friday
[01:05.83]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[01:09.83]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[01:13.55]I'll be waiting for love waiting for love
[01:17.99]To come around
[01:20.24]
[02:25.01]For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
[02:28.84]In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
[02:32.52]For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
[02:36.36]With something to believe in
[02:40.11]
[02:40.62]Monday left me broken
[02:43.56]Tuesday I was through with hoping
[02:47.28]Wednesday my empty arms were open
[02:51.05]Thursday waiting for love waiting for love
[02:55.72]Thank the stars it's Friday
[02:58.36]I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
[03:02.33]Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
[03:06.05]I'll be waiting for love waiting for love
[03:10.48]To come around
